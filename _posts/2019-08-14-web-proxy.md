You can connect to the Internet or communicate with other devices after setting up network such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks or etc.

When Galaxy Watch is not connected to a mobile phone, it is still possible to be connected to internet through Watch's Wi-Fi or cellular networks.

However, if Galaxy Watch's Wi-Fi is on and it is connected to a phone at the same time, it will communicate with a network through the phone because Wi-Fi is automatically disabled internally.

In other word, when the Watch is paired and connected to a phone through Bluetooth, it utilizes data connectivity from the connected phone instead of Watch's Wi-Fi or cellular networks. This is because the consumption of battery can be reduced in this way.

For instance, Galaxy Watch use its own data connectivity(Wi-Fi or cellular networks) to transmit/receive http/https packets when it is not paired with the mobile phone.
However, it can do the same thing after applying Web Proxy when it is connected to a phone via Bluetooth.
In this posting, you will learn how to access the Internet whether Galaxy Watch is connected to a mobile phone or not.

Let's take the scenario below and find out how to

 - Download a file from a host server

 - Request data from a specified resource

## Declare the necessary privileges

To access the Internet and use [ConnectionManager API][TizenConnectionManager], the following privileges are required:

```c#
<privileges>
    <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/internet</privilege>
    <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/network.get</privilege>
</privileges>
```

You should declare them in manifest file of your application.

In particular, `http://tizen.org/privilege/internet` privilege requires a user permission because accessing the Internet can charge users extra.

:star: **Info**: To learn how to get a user's permission, please check the posting [`Galaxy Watch: working with user privacy related permissions in Tizen .NET Applications`][user-privacy-related-permissions].
{: .notice--danger} 

## Check the Connectivity

 > use ConnectionManager API

With the [type][ConnectionItem_Type] and [state][ConnectionItem_State] of the current connectivity, we can find out if Galaxy Watch is connected to phone or not and also if Wi-Fi is activated on your Galaxy watch or not.

Let's check the [type][ConnectionItem_Type] and [state][ConnectionItem_State] of the current network connectivity with `ConnectionManager` API.

```c#
using Tizen.Network.Connection;

ConnectionItem connection = ConnectionManager.CurrentConnection;
Tizen.Log.Info(Program.LOG_TAG,
"Connection(" + currentConnection.Type + ", " + currentConnection.State + ")");

if (connection.Type == ConnectionType.Disconnected) {
    // There is no available connectivity

} else if (connection.Type == ConnectionType.Ethernet) {
    // When Galaxy Watch has a Bluetooth connection to a mobile phone

} else if (connection.Type == ConnectionType.Cellular) {
    // When Galaxy watch communicate with a network through cellular network,
    //  without access to a smartphone

} else if (connection.Type == ConnectionType.WiFi) {
    // When Galaxy watch communicate with a network through Wi-Fi network,
    //  without access to a smartphone

}

```

### Use WebProxy

When Galaxy Watch has a Bluetooth connection to a smart phone, you can make your application to access the Internet by using the Web proxy.

To start with, you can get the current proxy info by calling [ConnectionManager.GetProxy()][ConnectionManager.GetProxy] and then set Web proxy information to access the Internet as follows:

```c#
else if (connection.Type == ConnectionType.Ethernet) {
    // Get the current proxy information
    var proxyAddress = ConnectionManager.GetProxy(AddressFamily.IPv4);
    WebProxy webproxy = new WebProxy(proxyAddress, true);
    // Set proxy information to the HttpWebRequest
    request.Proxy = webproxy;
}
```


## Access the Internet
As mentioned above, we're going to get data and download a file from a host server.


### 1. Request data

You can create a `HttpWebRequest` instance with the URI of a specified resource to request resources such as a Web page or a file from a host server and then request data using `GET` method.

```c#
using System.Net;

    HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/");
    request.Method = "GET";
    HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();

    // Get the stream containing content returned by the server.
    Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();
    // Open the stream using a StreamReader for easy access.
    StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);
    // Read the content.
    string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd();
    // Display the content and print log.
    LabelText += responseFromServer;
    Log.Info(Program.LOG_TAG, "responseFromServer :" + responseFromServer);
    // Clean up the streams and the response.
    reader.Close();
    response.Close();
```

When you press the `GetData` button, you can see the following screen.

### 2. Download a File

You can download a file from a host server using `WebClient`.

```c#
WebClient webClient = new WebClient();

if (ConnectionManager.CurrentConnection.Type == ConnectionType.Ethernet)
{
    // In case that Samsung Galaxy Watch is connected to a mobile phone,
    // Use web proxy
    webClient.Proxy = new WebProxy(ConnectionManager.GetProxy(AddressFamily.IPv4), true);
}

webClient.DownloadFileCompleted += WebClient_DownloadFileCompleted;
webClient.DownloadProgressChanged += WebClient_DownloadProgressChanged;

string DownloadsFolder = Path.Combine(Tizen.Applications.Application.Current.DirectoryInfo.Data, "Downloads");
string pathToNewFile = Path.Combine(DownloadsFolder, Path.GetFileName(FileToDownload));

// Download a file asynchronously
webClient.DownloadFileAsync(new Uri("https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_328/BigBuckBunny_512kb.mp4"),
pathToNewFile);
```

####  - Run In the Background

Tizen restricts apps from running in the background to save the device's limited resources such as memory, battery, and etc. and to create a better app execution environment.

Galaxy Watches generally go into an idle state as the screen turns off when there is no user input.

However, if you want to play music, download files, or exchange data with other devices, it should continue to perform even if the app runs in the background.

In the following cases, Tizen allows apps to keep running even if they are running in the background:

| Category | Description |
| :-: | :--- |
| Media | Playing audio, recording, and outputting streaming video in the background |
| Download | Downloading data with the Tizen Download manager API in the background |
| Background network | Processing general network operations in the background |
| Location | Processing location data in the background |
| Sensor (context) | Processing context data from sensors such as gesture in the background |
| IoT Communication/Connectivity | Communicating between external devices (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) in the background |

:star: **Info**: To get more details, check [how an application is allowed to run in the background.][background_category]
{: .notice--info} 

You should specify the certain background category in the manifest file to tell the system which background category app you want to run in the background.

Sometimes, the sample app needs to continue to download a file even in the background.

To do this, we're going to declare `background-category` in `tizen-manifest.xml` file as follows:

```c#
    <ui-application appid="org.tizen.example.AccessTheInternet" 

      exec="AccessTheInternet.dll" multiple="false" 

      nodisplay="false" taskmanage="true" type="dotnet" launch_mode="single">

        <background-category value="background-network" />

    </ui-application>
```

When you press the `Download` button, you can see the following screen.
