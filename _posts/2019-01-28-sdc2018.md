## General Contents
The general information about Tizen .NET was introduced on all three booths, and each booth introduced a specific part about Tizen .NET.

### Summary for the General Contents
  - Tizen .NET has been adopted to Tizen platform to give an enhanced development experience to the developers.
  - The well-known Visual Studio and C# language including .NET standard API are used to develop the application.
  - [Xamarin.Forms](http://developer.xamarin.com/), the Cross-Platform UI framework, is supported.
  - [Tizen Circular UI](https://github.com/samsung/Tizen.CircularUI) and [Tizen TV UI Controls](https://github.com/samsung/Tizen.TV.UIControls) which are the extensions of the Xamarin.Forms are introduced.
  - Real world Tizen .NET sample applications for the both Galaxy Watch and 2018 Smart TV are introduced.
  - All source code related to Tizen .NET is open in the GitHub.
  - Hands-on experience for developing Tizen .NET.

Visitors could experience the actual development environment including SDK, tools and guides. The environment for both Windows and macOS has been prepared. All types of Tizen emulators like Wearable, TV, and Mobile, also the different platform emulators like Android and iOS have been used to run the sample application.
The visitor could write a simple video player demo really easily and run the same application on all different platforms of emulators.


## Session
### What's New in Tizen .NET
There was a session by Vincent Kwon, who is responsible for the Tizen .NET framework, about "What's New in Tizen .NET".

> Tizen .NET was adapted to Samsung TV products last year and provided a convenient way to develop applications on Samsung TV devices. This year, the new Galaxy Watch products have also added Tizen .NET for a new application model. Developers can now benefit from the same productive development environment and useful APIs specially designed for Galaxy Watch devices. In this session, we will live update the Tizen .NET framework and SDK for the third-party application developers for Samsung Galaxy Watch and TVs.

## Review
There were many people visiting our booths during the conference, and we were very delighted to introduce and share what we've acheived. Obviously, we have a long way to go, but it was great to see people feel there had been a big progress in developing a Tizen application.<br/>
Thanks for all the partners visiting and giving the interests on the Tizen .NET.
