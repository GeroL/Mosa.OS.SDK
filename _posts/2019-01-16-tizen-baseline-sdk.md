## Overview
Setting up the development environment would be the first step for diving into the Tizen .NET world.
When you install the extension for either `Visual Studio 2017` or `Visual Studio Code`, you reach [the step]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/guides/environment#tizen-baseline-sdk) to install the `Tizen baseline SDK`.

## Tizen Baseline SDK
Installing `Tizen baseline SDK` or the `Tizen Studio` is required to develop Tizen applications because they include Tizen tools such as `Package Manager`, `Emulator Manager`, `Certificate Manager`, `Device Manager`, `sdb` and more.

## Tizen Baseline SDK Installer
[Download Tizen Baseline SDK](http://download.tizen.org/sdk/Installer/Latest/) is available for all OS types. You can download the installer for manual installation.<br/>
You can simply install this, for example like on your macOS, instead of installing the full `Tizen Studio`.<br/><br/>
