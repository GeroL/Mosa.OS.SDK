## Tizen .NET Portal is moving to Samsung Developers
[Tizen .NET Portal](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/) has been providing lots of information about developing Tizen .NET applications.
[Posts](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/posts/) have been keep updated and github board has been always opened for our developers.<br/>
Now, we are happy to announce that the portal will be integrated to the [Samsung Developers](https://developer.samsung.com/) website in January, 2020.

## Samsung Developers website will be renewed
Samsung Developers site will be renewed and Tizen .NET portal would be integrated in it. We are expecting to provide more information in our new home with all other Samsung developers materials.<br/>
Now developers don't need to wander around.<br/>
Just visit Samsung Developers and find everything about developing for Samsung in one place.

The new website will soon be released and we will keep you posted when it is open.  :smile:
