I am very pleased to announce the release of the Tizen extension for Visual Studio for Mac.
There have been absolutely a tons of Mac users out there and it used to be quite tricky to use Mac machine to develop Tizen .NET applications.

From Samsung Developer Conference 2019 which has been held on Oct 29-30 in San Jose, <b>Visual Studio for Mac Extension for Tizen</b> is officially provided.

## Find an extension in your Visual Studio for Mac
The extension is provided through an `Extension Manager` in Visual Studio for Mac. Find `Visual Studio for Mac Extension for Tizen` which is under `IDE extensions`.

## Installation guide
Check out <b>[this guide](https://developer.tizen.org/development/visual-studio-mac-extension-tizen)</b> to know about prerequisites and installation guide.
<br/><br/>
On `Prerequisites`, you will see the important notice about installing Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or OpenJDK 12 to use Tizen Baseline SDK.
Please make sure you use the exact versions because that part is where the most developers get in trouble.
