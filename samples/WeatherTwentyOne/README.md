# Weather '21

> This project is a copy of [JoonghyunCho/WeatherTwentyOne](https://github.com/JoonghyunCho/WeatherTwentyOne). See [here](https://github.com/JoonghyunCho/WeatherTwentyOne/commit/b541c7ebbc49fb68039d9359) to see what's actually added just for Tizen.

[Weather '21](https://github.com/davidortinau/WeatherTwentyOne) is a [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) app showcasing .NET 6 Preview progress created by David Ortinau.
This project is forked from [Weather '21](https://github.com/davidortinau/WeatherTwentyOne) and Tizen framework is added.

> The main page of [Weather '21](https://github.com/davidortinau/WeatherTwentyOne) is modified from `Shell` to `NavigationPage` on this project due to the temporal limitation of `Shell` on Tizen.
